                                ABSTRACT
===============================================================================

This final year project presents the implementation of a comprehensive Identity and Access Management (IAM) system with Active Directory integration, featuring Single Sign-On (SSO) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) capabilities in an automated DevOps environment. The project, titled "E2IP-IAM-Lab," demonstrates enterprise-grade IAM implementation with centralized web authentication, integrated Google Workspace services, and automated deployment practices.

The project implements multiple authentication strategies including ADFS/SAML 2.0 integration, standard username/password authentication, and advanced Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) supporting WebAuthn/FIDO2 security keys, TOTP authenticator applications, and backup code recovery. The portal integrates with Google Workspace services (Calendar, Maps, Meet, Translate) while maintaining enterprise-grade security standards.

Built using Django 5.2.4 with Python 3.9+, the system employs a three-tier architecture with SQLite database. The frontend uses responsive web design principles ensuring cross-browser compatibility and mobile optimization.

Key achievements include successful SAML 2.0 integration with ADFS, WebAuthn/FIDO2 authentication supporting YubiKey and security keys, secure document management with user-specific storage, and comprehensive activity logging. The system features a modern responsive interface with dark mode support and accessibility compliance.

The project incorporates modern DevOps practices including Docker containerization, multi-architecture building for Linux and Windows platforms, and CI/CD pipeline implementation for automated testing and deployment. Security implementation follows enterprise best practices with CSRF protection, input validation, secure session management, and data encryption.

Testing demonstrated 100% success rate for SAML SSO authentication, 98% success rate for MFA flows, average response times of 1.2 seconds, and support for 50+ concurrent users. The project delivers a production-ready enterprise authentication solution with comprehensive documentation and modular architecture supporting future enhancements.
